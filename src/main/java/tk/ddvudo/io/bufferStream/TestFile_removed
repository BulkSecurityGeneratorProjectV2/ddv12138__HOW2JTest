The future's not ours to see.What lies ahead?Here's what my sweetheart said:Que sera, sera,Whatever will be, will be;The future's not ours to see.Que sera, sera,What will be, will be.Now I have children of my own.They ask their mother,What will I be?I tell them tenderly:Que sera, sera,Whatever will be, will be;The future's not ours to see.Que sera, sera,What will be, will be.Que Sera, Sera!
